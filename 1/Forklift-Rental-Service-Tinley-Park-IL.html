<h3>Forklift Sales Near Me Tinley Park IL</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc. Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition. Watrana is today a pioneer brand for forklifts and spare parts in India.</p>
