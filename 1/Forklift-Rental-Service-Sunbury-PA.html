On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<h2>The Best Deals on Used Forklifts in Sunbury </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
