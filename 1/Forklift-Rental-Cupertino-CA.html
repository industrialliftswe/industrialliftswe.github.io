If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
