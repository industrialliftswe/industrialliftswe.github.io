<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.
