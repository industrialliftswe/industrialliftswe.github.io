<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts.

The counterbalanced, fuel-driven forklift is suited for outdoor use.
