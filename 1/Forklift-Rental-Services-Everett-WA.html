We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
