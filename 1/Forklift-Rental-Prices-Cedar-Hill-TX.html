Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.
