<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.

A hydraulic device with the capability of loading and unloading large stamping, bending or forming dies for industrial presses up to 400,000lbs.
