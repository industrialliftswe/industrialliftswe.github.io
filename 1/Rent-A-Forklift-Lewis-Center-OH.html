<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work.

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class II powered industrial trucks. Long-term maintenance and upkeep on these lifted trucks can be higher than standard models, so keep that in mind when considering your options. We are also engaged in selling Second Hand or Used Forklift. All types of dockboards should have a high friction surface, designed to prevent employees or trucks from slipping.</p>
