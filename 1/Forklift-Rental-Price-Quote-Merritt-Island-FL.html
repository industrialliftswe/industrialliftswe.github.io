<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,‚Äù are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>

<p>Safety requirements relating to the elements of design, operation and maintenance of powered industrial trucks - not including vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over the road hauling. If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further.
