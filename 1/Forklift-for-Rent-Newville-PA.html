<h2>Pallet Jack Newville</h2>

<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine.

The type of tires you choose for your forklift greatly depends on the type of forklift you purchase and the driving environment.
