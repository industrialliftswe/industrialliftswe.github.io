<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time.

In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period.

Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts.

Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
