<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident.
