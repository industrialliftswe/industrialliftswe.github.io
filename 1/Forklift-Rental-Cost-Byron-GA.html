<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift.

If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>
