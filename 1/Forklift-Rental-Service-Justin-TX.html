It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
