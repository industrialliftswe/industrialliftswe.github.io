Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications.

<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities.

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet.
