The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90Â° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
