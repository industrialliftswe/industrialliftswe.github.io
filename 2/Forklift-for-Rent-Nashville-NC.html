<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
