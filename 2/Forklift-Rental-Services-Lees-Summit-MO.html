The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Our annual look at the largest global manufacturers of lift trucks ranked by revenue.

The nine-model P-Series RT forklift range includes units with rated lift capacities from 5,000 to 30,000 pounds (24-inch load center), with two-, three-, and four-section mast configurations. Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
<p>JCB RT forklift models include the 930, 940, and 950, respectively rated at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 pounds lift capacity.

<p>It's not as easy to see vehicles around your lifted truck, especially if they're smaller passenger occupant vehicles or bikes. Like an articulated forklift, a pivoting-mast forklift can rotate its mast at a 90-degree angle to its body. That's why it's nice to rent a forklift when required. FORKLIFTCENTER BV's headquarters are located in the Amsterdam Port area. At EP we offer unique order pickers for sale solutions for every warehouse.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps‚Äù the jack to lift the skids with their own force.
