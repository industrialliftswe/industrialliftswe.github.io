<p>In recent times, significant growth has been observed owing to the demand for modern material handling equipment Furthermore, forklift manufacturers are also introducing advanced solutions which include integrating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips to increase productivity and enhance end-user experience by implementing the multiple-tasks approach in a warehouse.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
