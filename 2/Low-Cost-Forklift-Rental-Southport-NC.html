On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

Fork Size = Dimensions of lift truck forks, expressed as: thickness x width x length.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.
