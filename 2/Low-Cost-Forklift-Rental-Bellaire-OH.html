Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

<p>Gas powered forklifts are more popular than their electric counterparts. Although they are versatile machines, you'll need the right size for the job. Our Rental Purchase Option (RPO) provides customers with an opportunity to acquire equipment by building equity over the rental period. When properly operated and maintained, a forklift is an invaluable piece of equipment.</p>
<p>You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires. Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop.</p>
