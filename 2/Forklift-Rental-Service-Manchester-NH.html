As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
