<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
