<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO. This is because the center of gravity for a loaded life is actually the combined center of gravity for both the lift and the load. The damage that can be done by this forklift can be to objects and people other than the operator.
