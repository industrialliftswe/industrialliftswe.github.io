<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. An overloaded pallet jack is likely to break down and can pose a serious safety hazard for its operators. The Rough Terrain Pallet Truck comes with Extended Raised Height compared to standard pallet trucks. With the largest window of any stockpicker, the Crown SP Series makes operators clearly more productive. We are offering Godrej 2.5 Ton Hand Pallet Truck to our clients.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>Whether a complete beginner or an experienced operator, our range of forklift training benefits individuals or employees wanting to develop their skills. Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.

<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these. In addition to mapping out a safe route for the pallet jack, the worker should make certain that the equipment will not be overloaded. We manufacture and supply excellent Electric Pallet Trucks, which are engineered by our well-trained, experienced and qualified professionals.</p>
