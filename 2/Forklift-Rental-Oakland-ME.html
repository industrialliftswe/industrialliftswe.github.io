<p>Stringent emission norms are driving the demand for electric forklifts. Most forklifts have a three-point suspension system. There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
