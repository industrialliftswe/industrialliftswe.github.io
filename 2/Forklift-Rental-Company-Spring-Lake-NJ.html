<h3>Forklift Training Osha Spring Lake NJ</h3>
<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,‚Äù says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>

The lift truck industry experienced a host of new equipment innovations over the past year.
