<p>Do you want to add some ride height to your vehicle? Other features include programmable electric hand control, which make a safer, more efficient and more easily maintainable Electric Pallet Trucks. If you need a quality electric order picker for your warehouse, we invite you to check out our great range online, or you can call one of our expert consultants any time to discuss your needs on 1300 536 276. This process is repeated several times to pump up the pallet jack.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
