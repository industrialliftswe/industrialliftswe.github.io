<p>Forklift on hire you can find on heavy equipments. Other forklifts raise the operator with the forks, or are operated from a standing position. Ahern Rentals has over 40,000 pieces of equipment and vehicles available for rent across the US. A work platform of at least 20 inches wide must be securely attached to the lifting carriage or forks. Standard counterbalance forklifts require aisles of approximately 13 ft wide to effectively turn, navigate, and move pallets.</p>
