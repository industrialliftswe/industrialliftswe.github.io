Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv. A little bigger than a 5,000 lb. truck, the 6,000 lb. electric 4-wheel has a different frame and larger battery compartment.

From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>
