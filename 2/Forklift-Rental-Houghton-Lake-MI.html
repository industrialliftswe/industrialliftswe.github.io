<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts.

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
