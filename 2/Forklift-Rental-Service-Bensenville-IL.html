<p>The BT Levio R-series powered pallet truck range are perfect for long-distance handling of multiple loads. Our product range includes low profile pallet truck. PA Industrial Equipment has an extensive selection of high quality, dependable, economical used forklifts. Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load at maximum elevation shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a slope of 4 percent about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
