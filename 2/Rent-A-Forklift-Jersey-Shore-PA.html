<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system. A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads. In fact, most body lift kits are designed to work with suspension lift kits. Here, Linde uses protective operator platforms in the pallet trucks and equips pedestrian models with protective combined braking and assistance systems: The reverse current brakes are automatically active when the operator releases the drive pedal or switch.</p>
