We will quickly and efficiently help you find the perfect equipment for your rental needs. 2+ years of experience operating the Counterbalance forklift. A truck-mounted forklift.

First, body lift kits are simple and straightforward in application and use. That includes lift kits for different trucks to get you set up for whatever adventure you have planned.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Potsdam </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>

A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
