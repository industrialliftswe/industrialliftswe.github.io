Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load.
