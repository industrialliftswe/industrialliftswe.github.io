<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires.

Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions.

<p>Sunbelt Rentals offers a variety of forklift equipment for any type of project. So, unless you're asking for a specific type of lift truck by name, you likely want a forklift. Our type of forklift at the Western Illinois University physical plant is a sit down rider type with the forklift that has a counterbalance in the rear. No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>Our ranges of products like Standard Hand Hydraulic Pallet Truck are designed and developed using advanced technology and superior quality raw material. In the electric forklift, the battery acts partially as a counterweight which saves space. Designed to automatically lock the pallet for a secure grip, the Automatic Pallet Grip feature provides optimum control of the load.</p>
