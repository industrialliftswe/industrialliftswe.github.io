<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary. The point of these vehicles seems mostly to project an obnoxiously aggressive attitude over all other drivers. If you're passionate about off-roading , then lifting your truck is a great choice.</p>
