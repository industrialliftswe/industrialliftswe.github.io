Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
