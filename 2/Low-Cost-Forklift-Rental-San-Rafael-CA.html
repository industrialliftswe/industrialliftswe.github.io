The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of new and used all terrain forklifts for sale. For example, some forklifts operates better outside; others have the ability to reach loads located high up in racks.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
