This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>

Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions.
